			A little while ago, I started realized that I could always come up with ideas, but never seemed to do anything with them. I was lacking inspiration. We could all use some inspiration, ideas that are powerful enough to surge past implied boundaries. Ideas that motivate us, pushing us forward. But no matter how great we want to become, we all have to start somewhere.
